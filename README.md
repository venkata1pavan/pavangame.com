Design Choices:
Color Scheme:
We selected a color scheme with a light background color (#f2f2f2). This choice was made to ensure good readability and contrast, creating a visually pleasing atmosphere for the game.
Font:
We opted for the Arial font family because it is widely available and easy to read across different devices and screen sizes. This choice enhances the game's accessibility.
Layout:
The game elements are organized in a centered layout. This layout choice makes the game visually balanced and user-friendly. "Player 1" and "Player 2" sections are placed side by side to facilitate easy comparison of choices.
CSS Usage:
Responsive Design:
To make the game responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, we employed CSS media queries. These queries adjust the layout and font size for smaller screens, ensuring the game remains playable and readable on different devices. For instance, we increased the margin between elements and reduced the font size on smaller screens to maintain readability.
Button Styling:
CSS styles were applied to the "Play" button to enhance its appearance. When users hover over the button, the background color changes, providing visual feedback and improving the interactive experience.
Image Styling:
Fixed width and height values were defined for the game choice images (rock, paper, scissor) using CSS. This consistency ensures that the images scale appropriately for different screen sizes, maintaining a uniform appearance.
Text Styling:
The font size and color of the game result text were adjusted through CSS to make it prominently visible and easy to read. This choice ensures that users can quickly understand the outcome of each game round.
Margins and Spacing:
CSS was used to create adequate spacing between elements through margins and padding. Proper spacing contributes to a well-organized layout and enhances the overall visual appeal of the game.
These design choices and CSS techniques were carefully implemented to create a rock-paper-scissors game that is both user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, the use of responsive design ensures that the game functions seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices, improving the user experience.
